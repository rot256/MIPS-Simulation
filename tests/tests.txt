Tests


In SegfaultSimulator (SS) we focused on great tests and exceptionally high code quality,
we therefore have thorough test of every possible edge case with systematic unit tests.
In all seriousness, there are 3 tests.

fib_rec.S    : A recursive implementation of fibonacci to test the stack (Load Word & Store Word)
arithmetic.S : Some shitty attempt at implementing a LFSR
jumps.S      : Testing branching.

Our tests are pretty complex - because we were too lazy to test every instruction seperatly.
All three tests are passed, but this is by no means a garantee that SegfaultSimulator won't live up to it's name.
